## TL;DR

Adversarial examples are malicious images with visually imperceptible perturbations. Tight Lp-norm bounds do a bad job for constraining adversarial perturbation. To this end, we propose *Demiguise Attack* - to craft **unrestricted perturbation** via Perceptual Similarity.

Adversarial examples are crafted with Demiguise-C&W (top) and C&W (L2) (bottom). C&W (L2) crafts spottable perturbations with arbitrary noise. Demiguise-C&W crafts much larger perturbations with rich semantic information while maintaining imperceptibility.

## Comments

I am the co-first author of this paper, which was accepted at [IJCAI 2021](https://www.ijcai.org/proceedings/2021/0430). This work was done when I was research assistant after I graduated (BSc. at Beijing Institute of Technology). I am responsible for most of the experiments and paper writing.
